# Univa Orrery

**Univa Orrery** is an interactive web application designed to simulate and visualize planetary systems, satellites, and other celestial bodies. This project integrates 3D models and data-driven animations, allowing users to explore planets, satellites, and orbits in a dynamic and immersive way. Built with React, Framer Motion, Three.js, and other modern web technologies, the app provides a unique and educational experience.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models:** Visualize planets, satellites, and celestial objects using Three.js and React Three Fiber.
- **Dynamic Search:** Instantly search and filter planets and satellites within the app.
- **Smooth Animations:** Incorporates Framer Motion for seamless transitions and animations.
- **Planetary Data:** View detailed descriptions and key data points (like distance and orbital parameters) for each celestial body.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Gsap (for animations)
  - Three.js / React Three Fiber (for 3D rendering)
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
